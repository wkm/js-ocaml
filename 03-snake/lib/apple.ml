   Make sure to inspect the mli to understand the signature of[create]. [create]
   will take in the height and width of the board area, as well as a list of
   locations where the apple cannot be generated, and create a [t] with a random
   location on the board.

   Hint:
   - You can generate a random int up to [bound] via [Random.int bound].
   - You can pick a random element out of a list using [List.random_element_exn list].
