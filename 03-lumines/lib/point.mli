(* It is useful to refer to points in our grid using this record. This allows us
   to avoid making mistakes about which coordinate is the row and which is the
   column

   We have provided a selection of useful functions, but feel free to add any
   others you find you want *)
type t =
  { col : int
  ; row : int

(* [add] takes two t's and returns the t that is the sum of their rows and columns *)
val add : t -> t -> t

(* [compare_by_row] returns:
   - 0 if the rows are equal
   - a positive number if the first is greater than the second
   - a negative number if the first is less than  the second *)
val compare_by_row : t -> t -> int

(* [compare_by_col] returns:
   - 0 if the cols are equal
   - a positive number if the first is greater than the second
   - a negative number if the first is less than  the second *)
val compare_by_col : t -> t -> int

(* [For_drawing] is a module that is useful for the graphics rendering part of
   the library. Feel free to ignore all these functions *)
